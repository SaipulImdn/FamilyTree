# Family Tree

A simple Family Tree application implemented in Go. This application uses basic tree traversal methods (DFS and BFS) to visualize relationships in a family structure.

---

## Features

- **Add Family Members**: Manage family members with parent-child relationships.
- **Tree Traversal**: Display the family tree using:
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- **Clear Output**: Structured output resembling an actual tree.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd FamilyTree
````

2. **Install Go**: Ensure you have Go installed on your system. If not, download it from [golang.org](https://golang.org/dl/).

3. **Build the Application:**

   ```bash
   go build -o FamilyTree cmd/main.go
   ```

---

## Usage

1. **Run the Application:**

   ```bash
   go run cmd/main.go
   ```

2. **Expected Output**: The application will display the family tree using both DFS and BFS methods.

### Example Output

```
Family Tree (DFS):
Root
├── Alice
│   └── Charlie
└── Bob

Family Tree (BFS):
Root
 └── Alice
 └── Bob
 └── Charlie
```
